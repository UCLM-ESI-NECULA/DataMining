## Introduction

### Relationship between Consumption and Price
The consumption of fruits and vegetables is directly related to the price of those products. With an increase in the price, there is a consumption decrease. This indicates an inverse relationship between price and consumption. We can determine some groups of products that are more affected than others.

### Consumption during the pandemic
- In the first months of the pandemic, people consumed more fruits and vegetables compared to the same period of the previous years
- There are patterns of consumption of specific categories of fruits and vegetables during the pandemic like the citrus fruits were bought more because people thought it could help with the “influence”.

The third statement remains the same.

### Relationship between Import and Price during the pandemic
- The import of fruits and vegetables in Spain during COVID-19 decreased compared to the previous years. These fewer imports lead to an increase in the price
- The products that had a high dependency on imports from specific countries were more affected by the rise of the price compared with the products with less dependency.
