### Hypothesis
The variation in the average consumption per person of specific food products in Spain is influenced by changes in the average price per kilogram for those products."

**Explanation:**
We propose that when the price of a particular food product goes down, people tend to consume more of it, and when prices rise, consumption decreases. This hypothesis suggests an inverse relationship between price and consumption, indicating that consumers adjust their consumption habits based on price changes.
